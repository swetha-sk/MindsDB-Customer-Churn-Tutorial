# MindsDB Tutorial: Predicting Customer Churn

Welcome to this tutorial on using MindsDB to predict customer churn! In this guide, you'll learn how to leverage MindsDB's powerful machine learning capabilities to forecast customer churn using a dataset of customer behaviors and demographics.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of SQL
- A MindsDB account
- A dataset for customer churn (e.g., from Kaggle)

## Step 1: Setting Up MindsDB

1. *Sign Up for MindsDB:*
   - Visit the [MindsDB website](https://mindsdb.com) and create an account.
   - Log in to your MindsDB account.

2. *Create a Project:*
   - Once logged in, navigate to the "Projects" tab.
   - Click "Create Project" and name it "Customer Churn Prediction".

## Step 2: Preparing Your Dataset

1. *Obtain the Dataset:*
   - Download a customer churn dataset from a source like Kaggle. For this tutorial, we'll use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset.

2. *Upload the Dataset:*
   - Go to your "Customer Churn Prediction" project.
   - Click "Upload Dataset" and select your dataset file (e.g., Telco-Customer-Churn.csv).

## Step 3: Exploring the Dataset

1. *View the Dataset:*
   - After uploading, click on the dataset to view its contents.
   - Verify that the dataset includes relevant features such as customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, tenure, PhoneService, Contract, and Churn.

## Step 4: Creating a Predictor

1. *Define the Predictor:*
   - In MindsDB, navigate to the "Predictors" tab.
   - Click "Create Predictor" and fill in the required information:
     - *Name:* ChurnPredictor
     - *Input Dataset:* Select your uploaded dataset.
     - *Target Column:* Set to Churn (the column you want to predict).

2. *Train the Predictor:*
   - Click "Train Predictor" and let MindsDB process the data.
   - The training process will take some time, depending on the dataset size.

## Step 5: Querying the Predictor

1. *Run Predictions:*
   - Once the training is complete, go to the "SQL Editor" tab.
   - Run a SQL query to predict churn for new or existing customers. For example:

    sql
    SELECT customerID, Churn AS predicted_churn
    FROM ChurnPredictor
    JOIN your_dataset_name
    ON ChurnPredictor.customerID = your_dataset_name.customerID;
    

2. *Analyze Predictions:*
   - Review the predictions to understand which customers are likely to churn.
   - You can visualize the results using MindsDB's built-in tools or export the predictions for further analysis in your preferred data visualization tool.

## Step 6: Fine-Tuning and Retraining

1. *Adjust the Model:*
   - Based on the initial predictions, you might notice areas for improvement.
   - You can add more features, clean your data further, or balance the dataset to improve accuracy.

2. *Retrain the Model:*
   - Make the necessary adjustments to your dataset.
   - Go back to the "Predictors" tab, select ChurnPredictor, and click "Retrain Predictor".

## Step 7: Automating Predictions

1. *Set Up Automated Predictions:*
   - MindsDB allows you to automate the prediction process for new data entries.
   - Use the "Automate" feature to set up schedules for automatic retraining and prediction.

## Conclusion
